- Had error importing the GLTF character
- SO FUCKING CLOSE
- Make sure you fix hrothgar female button missing in the Female Rigs because chatgpt thinks the hrothgar is not available yet.

- Needs to join all the mesh objects
- Needs to set the armature modifiers target to n_root
- Make sure that when you do change the assets that the Elezen female name thing is fixed back to Elezen Female



- check if the assets are fine in the last upload to makers guild?
for some reason the bone constraints on the feet and the hands still seem to be fucked up like before the hana fix so that too needs to get checked.
